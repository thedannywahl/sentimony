# Emoji Sentiment Ranking

## Description
In this paper we present the Emoji Sentiment Ranking, the first emoji sentiment lexicon of 751 emojis. The lexicon was constructed from over 1.6 million tweets in 13 European languages, annotated for sentiment by human annotators. In the corpus, probably the largest set of manually annotated tweets, 4% of the tweets contained emojis. The sentiment of the emojis was computed from the sentiment of the tweets in which they occur, and reflects the actual use of emojis in a context.
