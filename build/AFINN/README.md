## Build
```bash
npm run build:afinn
```

The build file (`build.js`) reads the AFINN data source (`AFINN-en-165.txt`), transforms it to JSON, and outputs the file `AFINN.json`.

## Data Structure
### `AFINN-en-165.txt`
```
abandon	-2
abandoned -2
```

### `AFINN.json`
The AFINN data file does not contain a header row, so header values of `word` and `score` have been presumed.

```json
[
  {
    "word": "abandon",
    "score": "-2"
  },
  {
    "word": "abandoned",
    "score":"-2"
  }
]
```
